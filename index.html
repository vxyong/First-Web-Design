                "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken 
                idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was 
                born and I will give you a complete account of the 
                system, and expound the actual teachings of the 
                great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. N
                o one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
                because it is pleasure, but because those who do not 
                kno w how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter 
                consequences that are extremely painful. 
                Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical 
                exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
